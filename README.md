# Creating-Customer-Segments-with-Arvato
### Project Overview
This project, is about applying unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used for this project is provided by the Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries: 

  1. Python
  2. NumPy
  3. Pandas
  4. scikit-learn 
  5. Matplotlib

### File Description
There are four files associated with this project:
- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns
- `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook subdivided into sections with guidelines for completing the project.
