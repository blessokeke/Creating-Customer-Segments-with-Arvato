# Creating-Customer-Segments-with-Arvato
This project, is about applying unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used for this project is provided by the Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
